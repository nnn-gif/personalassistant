# Audio Recording Test Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **0 Duration Problem**: 
   - The audio stream was being forgotten with `std::mem::forget(stream)` which prevented proper cleanup
   - Fixed by properly tracking sample count and finalizing the WAV writer

2. **Implementation Changes**:
   - Removed the `stream` field from `ActiveRecording` since it's not Send-safe
   - Added proper sample counting in the audio callback
   - Ensured WAV writer is properly finalized on stop
   - Calculate duration from sample count: `sample_count / (sample_rate * channels)`

3. **Key Code Changes**:
   - Track sample count in audio callback
   - Properly finalize WAV writer in `stop_recording`
   - Use `std::mem::forget` to keep stream alive without violating Send/Sync

## How to Test

1. Open the app and go to Audio Recorder
2. Select an audio device (should auto-select first device)
3. Click "Start Recording" 
4. Speak or make some noise
5. Click "Stop" after a few seconds
6. Check the recording list - it should show:
   - Non-zero duration (e.g., "0:05" for 5 seconds)
   - File size in KB/MB
   - Sample rate and channels
7. Click the Play button to test playback

## Expected Results

- Recordings should have proper duration (not 0:00)
- Files should be playable with audio content
- File sizes should be reasonable (e.g., ~1MB per minute at 48kHz stereo)
