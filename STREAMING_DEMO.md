# Streaming Chat UI Demo

## What's New

The Personal Assistant chat UI now supports streaming responses with thinking indicators!

### Features Added:

1. **Streaming Responses**
   - Messages appear progressively as they're generated
   - Smooth character-by-character streaming effect
   - Real-time updates without blocking the UI

2. **Thinking Indicator**
   - Shows when the AI is processing your request
   - Displays different stages: "Preparing response" → "Searching documents" → "Generating response"
   - Progress bar for visual feedback
   - Animated icons based on the current operation

3. **Enhanced Message Display**
   - Live indicator for messages being streamed
   - Blinking cursor at the end of streaming text
   - Smooth animations for message appearance
   - Source documents appear with fade-in animation

### How It Works:

1. **Backend Streaming Service** (`src-tauri/src/services/streaming_chat.rs`)
   - Simulates streaming by chunking responses
   - Emits events for each stage of processing
   - Supports both general chat and document-based chat

2. **Frontend Hook** (`src/hooks/useStreamingChat.ts`)
   - Listens to streaming events from the backend
   - Manages streaming message state
   - Provides easy-to-use API for components

3. **UI Components**
   - `ThinkingIndicator.tsx`: Beautiful animated thinking state
   - `StreamingMessageList.tsx`: Enhanced message list with streaming support
   - Updated `UnifiedChat.tsx` to use streaming

### Testing the Feature:

1. Start the app: `npm run tauri:dev`
2. Go to the chat interface
3. Type a message and send it
4. Watch as:
   - Thinking indicator appears with progress
   - Response streams in character by character
   - Sources appear if using knowledge mode
   - Live indicator shows during streaming

### Technical Details:

The streaming system uses Tauri's event system to communicate between backend and frontend:

```typescript
// Event types
enum StreamUpdateType {
  Thinking = 'thinking',
  StreamStart = 'streamStart', 
  StreamDelta = 'streamDelta',
  StreamEnd = 'streamEnd',
  Error = 'error',
  SourcesFound = 'sourcesFound',
  Complete = 'complete'
}
```

Each update contains:
- `conversationId`: Which conversation this belongs to
- `messageId`: The specific message being streamed
- `updateType`: What kind of update this is
- `content`: Full content so far
- `delta`: New content in this update
- `metadata`: Additional info (thinking steps, sources, etc.)

### Future Enhancements:

- [ ] Real WebSocket streaming when Ollama supports it
- [ ] Adjustable streaming speed
- [ ] Cancel streaming in progress
- [ ] Stream multiple responses in parallel
- [ ] Token count display
- [ ] Estimated time remaining
